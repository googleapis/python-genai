# Project 1

## Overview

Project 1 is designed to provide a robust application framework using TypeScript. It serves as an entry point for building scalable applications with a focus on type safety and modularity.

## Installation

To get started with Project 1, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application by running:

```
npm start
```

This will execute the entry point defined in `src/app.ts`.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `app.ts`: The main entry point of the application.
  - `types/`: Contains type definitions used throughout the project.
    - `index.ts`: Exports interfaces and types for better type safety.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file specifying compiler options.
